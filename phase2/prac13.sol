PRACTICAL: Read state after redeploy
CONCEPT: Deployment resets
=========================================================

OBJECTIVE

- Learn what happens when a contract is redeployed
- Understand that each deployment creates NEW storage
- Learn why previous state does not carry forward
- Understand deployment-level state isolation

---------------------------------------------------------
CORE IDEA
---------------------------------------------------------

Every contract deployment creates:
- new contract address
- new storage
- new blockchain state

Old deployed contract state remains separate.

---------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDING
---------------------------------------------------------

Redeploying a contract does NOT:
- update old contract
- preserve old storage
- continue previous state

Instead:
A completely NEW contract instance is created.

---------------------------------------------------------
REAL-WORLD IMPORTANCE
---------------------------------------------------------

Critical for understanding:
- upgradeable contracts
- migrations
- proxy patterns
- state persistence
- deployment architecture

---------------------------------------------------------
AUDITOR FOCUS
---------------------------------------------------------

Auditors inspect:

- Does redeployment break state?
- Is migration logic safe?
- Is old state lost?
- Are users aware of deployment resets?
- Are upgrade mechanisms secure?

EXECUTION FLOW
=========================================================

FIRST DEPLOYMENT

Contract Address:
0xAAA...

INITIAL STATE:

number = 0

---------------------------------------------------------

CALL:
setNumber(500)

STATE NOW:

number = 500

Stored permanently in FIRST contract.

---------------------------------------------------------

REDEPLOY CONTRACT

New Contract Address:
0xBBB...

IMPORTANT:
This is a COMPLETELY NEW contract.

---------------------------------------------------------

NEW CONTRACT STATE

number = 0

Reason:
Fresh deployment = fresh storage

---------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT OBSERVATION

Old contract still exists:

0xAAA...
number = 500

New contract:

0xBBB...
number = 0

=========================================================
REMIX TESTING
=========================================================

STEP 1:
Deploy contract

EXPECTED:
number() => 0

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2:
Call:
setNumber(123)

EXPECTED:
number() => 123

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 3:
Deploy SAME contract AGAIN

IMPORTANT:
New contract instance appears below in Remix.

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 4:
Check number()

EXPECTED:
0

OBSERVE:
Previous state NOT preserved.

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 5:
Compare BOTH deployed contracts

OLD CONTRACT:
number => 123

NEW CONTRACT:
number => 0

=========================================================
EDGE CASE TESTS
=========================================================

TEST:
Deploy contract multiple times

EXPECTED:
Each deployment starts fresh

---------------------------------------------------------

TEST:
Modify first deployment only

EXPECTED:
Second deployment unaffected

---------------------------------------------------------

TEST:
Modify second deployment

EXPECTED:
First deployment remains unchanged

=========================================================
IMPORTANT STORAGE UNDERSTANDING
=========================================================

CONTRACT STORAGE IS LINKED TO:

Contract Address

---------------------------------------------------------

Each deployment:
- gets unique address
- gets independent storage
- maintains separate state

---------------------------------------------------------

VERY IMPORTANT

Blockchain stores state PER CONTRACT ADDRESS.

Example:

0xAAA... => number = 500

0xBBB... => number = 0

=========================================================
WHY THIS MATTERS
=========================================================

Many beginners wrongly assume:

"Redeploy updates existing contract"

This is FALSE.

Redeploying creates:
an entirely new contract instance.

---------------------------------------------------------

Real protocols use:
- proxy contracts
- upgradeable patterns
- migrations

to preserve state across upgrades.

=========================================================
SECURITY / AUDITOR MINDSET
=========================================================

---------------------------------------------------------
1. STATE LOSS RISKS
---------------------------------------------------------

Redeployment may:
- lose balances
- lose ownership
- lose user funds
- reset protocol configuration

---------------------------------------------------------
2. MIGRATION SAFETY
---------------------------------------------------------

Auditors inspect:
- safe state migration
- upgrade handling
- storage compatibility

---------------------------------------------------------
3. USER CONFUSION
---------------------------------------------------------

Users may interact with:
- old deployment accidentally
- obsolete contracts
- outdated state

---------------------------------------------------------
4. FAKE CONTRACT RISKS
---------------------------------------------------------

Attackers may deploy:
fake versions of protocols.

Users may confuse:
- old contract
- upgraded contract
- malicious clone

=========================================================
ATTACK THINKING
=========================================================

ATTACK SCENARIO

Attacker redeploys fake protocol
with identical code/UI.

Users interact with wrong contract.

Result:
- stolen funds
- fake balances
- phishing attacks

---------------------------------------------------------

ANOTHER RISK

Improper upgrade process may:
- reset critical storage
- erase balances
- destroy protocol state

=========================================================
MINI CHALLENGE
=========================================================

Modify contract so that:

1. Store deployer address
2. Store deployment timestamp

HINT:

Use:
block.timestamp

and

msg.sender

inside constructor.

=========================================================
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS LEARNED
=========================================================

- Each deployment creates new contract address
- Storage belongs to specific contract instance
- Redeployment does NOT preserve state
- Old contracts remain on blockchain
- State persistence is contract-specific
- Deployments are isolated from each other
- Upgrade systems require special architecture
- Migration safety is critical
- Users may confuse deployments
- Auditors inspect upgrade/deployment risks

Audit Report

Title: Missing Deployment Metadata and Lack of Access Control in Redeployable State Contract

Severity: Medium

Reason: Contract state is reset on redeployment and critical deployment metadata is not protected or restricted.

Location:

Contract: DeploymentResetVul
Function: setNumber()

Vulnerability Description:
The DeploymentResetVul contract allows any external user to modify the state variable number using the setNumber() function without any access control restrictions.

Additionally, the contract does not enforce or protect deployment-level metadata such as deployer identity usage or controlled state initialization, which may lead to unsafe usage after redeployment.

Each redeployment creates a new contract instance with fresh storage, but there is no mechanism to prevent misuse of state updates in the new deployment.

Impact:
An attacker can freely modify the number state variable, leading to:

Unauthorized state modification
Manipulation of contract logic if number is used in protocol rules
Confusion between multiple deployed contract instances
Risk of users interacting with incorrect or outdated deployments

In real-world systems, this can lead to:

Funds loss due to interacting with wrong contract instance
Protocol misconfiguration after redeployment
Security risks due to fake or duplicate deployments

Proof of Concept:

Deploy the contract.
User A calls:
setNumber(123)
number becomes 123
Contract is redeployed creating a new instance.
New contract starts with:
number = 0
Any user can again call:
setNumber(999)
State is updated without restriction in the new deployment.

Root Cause:

setNumber() is declared public without access control.
No ownership restriction using msg.sender validation.
No protection or restriction of state modification after deployment.
Lack of safeguards for distinguishing or managing multiple deployments.

Recommendation:

Add access control using owner check:

require(msg.sender == owner, "Not Owner");

Restrict state modification to deployer only.

Ensure deployment metadata is properly used for validation:

owner = msg.sender;
timestamp = block.timestamp;
