PRACTICAL: Store address in state
CONCEPT: Address persistence
=========================================================

OBJECTIVE

- Learn how Solidity stores Ethereum addresses
- Understand persistent address storage on blockchain
- Learn how addresses are updated and retrieved
- Understand security risks of storing critical addresses

---------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS AN ADDRESS?
---------------------------------------------------------

An Ethereum address represents:
- user wallet
- smart contract
- admin account
- treasury wallet

Address type in Solidity:
address

Example:
0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835Cb2

---------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CONCEPT
---------------------------------------------------------

When an address is stored as a state variable:
- it is saved permanently in storage
- persists across transactions
- remains on blockchain until changed

---------------------------------------------------------
AUDITOR FOCUS
---------------------------------------------------------

Auditors check:

- Who can update stored address?
- Can attacker replace admin wallet?
- Is zero address validation missing?
- Can funds be redirected?
- Is address overwrite protected?

EXECUTION FLOW
=========================================================

INITIAL STATE

userAddress = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

This is called ZERO ADDRESS.

---------------------------------------------------------

CALL:
storeAddress(0x123...)

EVM ACTIONS:

1. Transaction reaches contract
2. Address arrives through calldata
3. EVM updates storage slot
4. Address stored permanently
5. Gas consumed for storage write

---------------------------------------------------------

CALL:
getAddress()

EVM ACTIONS:

1. Reads address from storage
2. Returns stored address
3. No state modification occurs

=========================================================
REMIX TESTING
=========================================================

NORMAL FLOW

STEP 1:
Deploy contract

EXPECTED:
userAddress() returns:

0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2:
Copy one Remix account address

Call:
storeAddress(<paste address>)

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 3:
Call:
userAddress()

EXPECTED:
Stored address returned correctly

---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 4:
Store another address

EXPECTED:
Old address overwritten with new one

=========================================================
EDGE CASE TESTS
=========================================================

TEST:
Store zero address

Call:
storeAddress(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

EXPECTED:
Works successfully

---------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE

In real protocols,
zero address is often INVALID.

Reason:
Funds sent to zero address are usually lost forever.

=========================================================
STORAGE OBSERVATION
=========================================================

Storage slot example:

Initial:
slot0 => 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

After update:
slot0 => user wallet address

After another update:
slot0 overwritten with new address

=========================================================
SECURITY / AUDITOR MINDSET
=========================================================

CRITICAL AUDITOR CHECKS

---------------------------------------------------------
1. MISSING ACCESS CONTROL
---------------------------------------------------------

Currently ANYONE can update address.

Danger:
Attacker can replace important wallet.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. ZERO ADDRESS VALIDATION
---------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
Contract allows zero address.

Real-world issue:
Funds or ownership may become unusable.

Auditors often expect:

require(_newAddress != address(0))

---------------------------------------------------------
3. ADDRESS OVERWRITE RISK
---------------------------------------------------------

If address represents:
- owner
- treasury
- signer
- reward wallet

then unauthorized overwrite becomes critical vulnerability.

=========================================================
ATTACK THINKING
=========================================================

ATTACK SCENARIO

Suppose stored address is treasury wallet.

Attacker calls:

storeAddress(attackerWallet)

Now:
- future funds go to attacker
- protocol treasury hijacked

---------------------------------------------------------

ANOTHER ATTACK

Attacker sets:

address(0)

Impact:
- protocol functionality breaks
- funds may become inaccessible
- ownership can be destroyed

=========================================================
MINI CHALLENGE
=========================================================

Modify contract so that:

1. Only deployer can update address
2. Zero address should be rejected

HINT:

Use:
require(_newAddress != address(0))

=========================================================
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS LEARNED
=========================================================

- Solidity supports address type
- Addresses can be stored permanently
- State variables persist on-chain
- Storage updates overwrite old values
- Zero address is special
- Missing validation creates vulnerabilities
- Access control is essential
- Critical addresses must be protected

=========================================================

Audit Report

Title: Missing Access Control and Zero Address Validation in storeAddress()

Severity: High

Reason: Unauthorized users can overwrite critical address values and zero address assignment may break protocol functionality.

Location:
        Contract: StoreAddressVul
        Function: storeAddress()

Vulnerability Description:
The storeAddress() function allows any external user to update the userAddress state variable because no access control mechanism is implemented.

Additionally, the contract does not validate against the zero address:
    address(0)

As a result, an attacker can:
        replace important protocol addresses
        redirect funds
        break ownership logic
        disable protocol functionality

Impact: An attacker can overwrite the stored address with an arbitrary address.

If this address represented:

treasury wallet
protocol owner
signer wallet
reward distributor

then the attacker could hijack protocol behavior or redirect future funds.

Additionally, setting the zero address may:
                    permanently lock functionality
                    burn funds accidentally
                    remove valid ownership references

Proof of Concept:
            1.Deploy the vulnerable contract.
            2.Initial state:
                    userAddress =
                    0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
            3.User A calls:
                    storeAddress(0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111)
            4.Attacker calls:
                    storeAddress(0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)
            5.State changes successfully.

Another attack:
        storeAddress(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

        Result:
        Critical address becomes unusable.

Root Cause:
The function is declared public without authorization checks.

No validation exists to reject:

address(0)

The contract blindly trusts external input.

Recommendation:
Restrict address updates to the contract owner and validate the new address before storing it.

Example:

require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
require(_newAddress != address(0), "Zero address");
*/
// patched code 
contract StoreAddress {

    address public userAddress;
    address public owner;

    constructor(){
        owner=msg.sender;
    }

    function storeAddress(address _newAddress) public {
        require(msg.sender==owner,"Only owner can update the address");
        require(_newAddress != address(0), "Address cannot be zero");
        userAddress = _newAddress;
    }

    function getAddress() public view returns (address) {
        return userAddress;
    }
}
